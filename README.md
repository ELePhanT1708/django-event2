# PLatfrom for arranging events 


## Idea 

For people who wastes time during trying to find partners as DJ, Photographer , Food vendor or etc. type of people on own event, which takes a lot LOT of time.

## Realisation :
Used DJANGO framework on front and back with template rendering. Created a lot of enntities connected via each other , as Partners, Clients , Events , MAnyTo-Many relations
implmented with middle addditional table for relations. 
First in life in there, I used select_related and try to use prefetch_related queries without any abstractions as usual for this optimiations methods))


## Problems: 

For filling this platform with clients needs to improve css/visualisations and need to create some JS cool stuff to be as concurents in trends)) 
From logic view almost all things were implemented as creating event , adding partners in event , creating locations as city , add one photo for profile of partners , users , and events too )) 


That's all for today
